/**
 * DocumentsPage Component
 *
 * This is a simple page component that serves as the entry point for the /documents route.
 * Currently, it acts as a placeholder or a secondary view for listing documents.
 *
 * Rationale:
 * Separate page for dedicated document management if needed, though most interactions
 * currently take place on the home page table.
